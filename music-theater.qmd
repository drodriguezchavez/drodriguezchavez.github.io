#### **Recent Shows I've Seen**

*Kimberly Akimbo* at the Curran Theatre is wonderful! Though the music is nothing spectacular, it's a polished piece of writing with wonderful set design. I also enjoyed *The Play That Goes Wrong* at SF Playhouse. Hilarious and went way further than I thought it was going to.

#### **Theaters I Recommend**

There are a lot of great theaters in the Bay Area. Below is a small subset that I frequent. However, for a more full list checkout [Theatre Bay Area](https://www.theatrebayarea.org) or [my own personal list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GJsyDc-R5UueHKNIg0VxwXyYjCFLqCkXAYSWuNblP0s/edit?usp=sharing) (where you can see which shows I'm planning on attending).

-   **The Orpheum, Golden Gate Theater, Curran Theatre**. These are all easily accessible by BART at show touring Broadway shows. Check out [NightOutNightOff](https://www.nightoutnightoff.org) for cheaper tickets to these shows.
-   **The Gateway Theatre**. Easily accessible by BART and have cheap tickets on TodayTix.
-   **Berkeley Playhouse.** Easily accessible by AC Transit and very close to campus.
-   **Berkeley Rep**. Easily accessible by BART. Does incredible shows but can get a little pricey. Try the Tuesday 12pm ticket releases for \$20 tickets.
-   **Shotgun Players**. Easily accessible by BART and AC Transit. Tend to have very community engaging shows.
-   **San Francisco Playhouse.** Easily accessible by BART. Really great quality and somehow manages to do during the week shows (except Mondays). Highly recommend their \$20 rush tickets which open 30min before show.

### What is graduate school?

Graduate school can mean many things to many folks. In general, it's a program from which you attend after attending an undergraduate institution and you receive a degree. There are specific graduate programs such as for medicine, dentistry, and law. *I will not be touching on these since those have a very specific set of requirements and application processes that I'm not very familiar with.*

There are also master's programs and doctoral programs. Within master's degrees, there's generally two branches of programming: professional or research-based. In a professional master's program, there is an emphasis on coursework and skill-building, potentially with an internship component. Whereas in a research-based master's, there is an emphasis on coursework but also the presentation of a master's thesis, which can get published. *Again, these are generalizations, and always check with whatever program you are interested in to learn more about the specifics.*

In doctoral programs, the emphasis is on contributing original research to the field, with two main components: a qualifying exam and a dissertation (often with a defense). In the United States, these degrees take around 5 years to complete (depending on the field some can take as little as 4 or as much as 8+ years).

Another main point to note is that while most graduate programs require payment to attend, [doctoral degrees are usually paid.]{.underline} You should never pay to attend a doctoral program. *Note that the pay will be different whether you choose to attend a public or private university, but there should be pay regardless.*

### How do I know if I want to go?

Graduate school, especially a doctoral program, is not something to be taken lightly. Here, I tried to distill the two main areas that I thought about before applying to graduate school.

### Questions to ask during the process

One of the biggest things about applying to graduate school for me was that there was a lot I didn't know. And there was a lot that I didn't know I didn't know. Below are some questions that are helpful to ask yourself throughout the process, as well as some additional ones to ask potential advisors and colleagues. *Note that in the "Additional resources" section I have a document containing a list of questions to keep in mind when interviewing at places.*

#### [to yourself]{.underline}

-   How much does location matter? weather? urban vs. rural? cost of living?
-   How much do I care about the amount I make after graduating college?
-   What kind of support do I need to succeed?
-   What do I want to get out of a PhD?
-   What do I want to able to have done in 4-7 years by being in this program?

#### [to your potential advisors]{.underline}

-   What are your expectations at individual meetings?
-   How often are you able to meet with students?
-   What are your thoughts on how the first two years should go in a PhD program?
-   How do you support your students in their career and throughout their PhD?
-   What is funding like in the program?

#### [to your potential colleagues / labmates]{.underline}

-   What was your thought process in deciding to go here? Why this lab?
-   How were the qualifying exams for you?
-   What do you have to deal with in this program? What makes you frustrated?
-   What is it like to be a woman or woman of color in this program? *replace with another affinity group if necessary*
-   How supportive is your advisor? career-wise? personally?
-   How would you describe the lab community? the program community?
-   Who helps you with the requirements and navigate the program?
-   What is the work-life balance like in your lab / in the program?
-   What do you do for fun? How do you destress?

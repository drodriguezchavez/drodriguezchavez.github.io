    "text": "Growing up, I always enjoyed math. It was fun to solve these puzzles and figure out what I can create with a set of given rules. In addition to this passion, I also enjoyed playing the piano, a requirement for many children of immigrant parents. By the time I entered high school, I had decided I was going to major in math and music… with no plan for what I would do after college. However, two crucial things happened my senior year: I took AP Environmental Science (APES) and I music directed a show for the first time.\nAfter taking APES, I knew that I had to combine math and environmental science somehow, but I wasn’t sure how. I took on a motto: “help someone or something, somewhere.” This led me on a 4-year journey into carbon cycle dynamics, oceanography, and population dynamics, until I ended up in the world of infectious disease modeling. After music directing, I realized that this was how to keep my creative skills alive while being in community with others. I ditched the music major and doubled in mathematics and environmental science.\nGraduate school was not a clear step to me until my third year of college. As a child of Mexican immigrants, I rarely saw myself represented in the mentors and professors I had. Though I am eternally grateful to everyone that helped guide me down this path, I am really passionate about the communities I’m a part of and I hope to be the mentor that my younger self wanted.\nWant to create your own free website? First create a quarto website on RStudio and make it a git repo. You then want to connect it to Github (learn more about Git here) and make sure you can publish it. Woohoo now you have your own free website!"

    "text": "Hello! My name is Daniela and I am an NSF Graduate Research & Chancellor’s Fellow at UC Berkeley in both the de Valpine and Boettiger labs. I’m really interested in infectious disease modeling and I plan to use this time to develop skills in statistical, computational, and mathematical modeling.\nOn this site you’ll get to know a little bit more about me, the research I’ve done (and am currently doing), and some of my community work. Because I am currently learning a lot of material on my own, I also intend to provide some write-ups in case that they are useful to anybody. Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time in the world of musical theater and I’m always happy to catch a show with someone new!"

    "text": "A classmate of mine in undergrad once told me that there are models that fit functions to data and then there are models that describe a theoretical framework but may not match data perfectly. The former by definition needs data while the latter can use data to corroborate theory. I am interested in gaining skills to do both of these!\n\nCurrent Work\nCurrently, I am exploring the spatio-temporal relationships between dengue, chikungunya, and dengue in Brazil from 2016-present. I am interested in learning how statistical models can better understand these interactions for forecasting and use dynamical systems modeling to better understand multi-pathogen systems. This work is being done in collaboration with Joe Lewnard.\n\n\nPublications\n\nde Marez, C., J. Callies, B. Haines, D. Rodriguez-Chavez, and J.

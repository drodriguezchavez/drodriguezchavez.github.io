    "text": "Recent Shows I’ve Seen\nThe two memorable shows from April are Forever Plaid at the Gateway Theatre (42nd St. Moon) and A Strange Loop at the Toni Rembe Theater (American Conservatory Theatre).\nIf you want a story with no plot, minimal set, and a lot of barbershop quartet sound, look no further than Forever Plaid. A jukebox musical from the late 80s, this show was essentially a barbershop quarter revue in the form of a show within a show (with some audience interaction). Accompanied by a combo of just piano and bass, the four actors used precise facial movements and tight, but intentional, choreography to bring each character to life, well more like after-life.\nAlso a show within a show… within a show… is A Strange Loop. Those of you who remember [title of show] might be worried about the potential for a cringe-meta mess, but this show is anything but that. Unapologetically black and queer, the audience is taken through the life of Usher and his six inner thoughts, each of whom plays additional characters throughout the show. A poignant question arising from the show is “what is the line between dramatization and caricature?” A mix of ballads, pop songs, and gospel themes propel the show forward, with the genre of the song often used for satirical enhancement. This is a story that needs to be told yesterday. Content warning for depictions of verbal abuse, physical abuse, and sexual scenes.\n\n\nRecent Shows I’ve Been In\nUPCOMING: Baby Rock at the Hollywood Fringe Festival\n\nMay 2024: Just My Type at Chanticleer’s Theatre\nOct-Nov 2023: Tintypes at Contra Costa Civic Theatre\nMay 2023: Family Copoli at Cornell University\nNovember 2022: Baby Rock at Cornell University\nNovember 2022: Avenue Q with the Melodramatics Theatre Company\n\n\n\nTheaters I Recommend\nThere are a lot of great theaters in the Bay Area. Below is a small subset that I frequent. However, for a more full list checkout Theatre Bay Area or my own personal list (where you can see which shows I’m planning on attending).\n\nThe Orpheum, Golden Gate Theater, Curran Theatre. These are all easily accessible by BART at show touring Broadway shows. Check out NightOutNightOff for cheaper tickets to these shows.\nThe Gateway Theatre. Easily accessible by BART and have cheap tickets on TodayTix.\nBerkeley Playhouse. Easily accesible by AC Transit and very close to campus.\nShotgun Players. Easily accessible by BART and AC Transit. Tend to have very community engaging shows."

    "text": "Growing up, I always enjoyed math. It was fun to solve these puzzles and figure out what I can create with a set of given rules. In addition to this passion, I also enjoyed playing the piano, a requirement for many children of immigrant parents. By the time I entered high school, I had decided I was going to major in math and music… with no plan for what I would do after college. However, two crucial things happened my senior year: I took AP Environmental Science (APES) and I music directed a show for the first time.\nAfter taking APES, I knew that I had to combine math and environmental science somehow, but I wasn’t sure how. I took on a motto: “help someone or something, somewhere.” This led me on a 4-year journey into carbon cycle dynamics, oceanography, and population dynamics, until I ended up in the world of infectious disease modeling. After music directing, I realized that this was how to keep my creative skills alive while being in community with others. I ditched the music major and doubled in mathematics and environmental science.\nGraduate school was not a clear step to me until my third year of college. As a child of Mexican immigrants, I rarely saw myself represented in the mentors and professors I had. Though I am eternally grateful to everyone that helped guide me down this path, I am really passionate about the communities I’m a part of and I hope to be the mentor that my younger self wanted.\nWant to create your own free website?

    "section": "",
    "text": "To start, let’s do the first thing many do when trying to learn about a new topic: go to the Wikipedia page for it. Let’s start with that first paragraph:\nIn statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data. This is achieved by maximizing a likelihood function so that, under the assumed statistical model, the observed data is most probable. The point in the parameter space that maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum likelihood estimate. The logic of maximum likelihood is both intuitive and flexible, and as such the method has become a dominant means of statistical inference. (Taken directly from Wikipedia.)\nHopefully if it’s not intuitive as of yet, it will be once we work through this. Let’s break down this first paragraph into various components: parameters, assumed probability distribution, observed data, likelihood function, and parameter space.\nLet’s first take about the assumed probability distribution. This is the type of distribution you assume your data is coming from. For example, for count data, we often use the Poisson distribution, denoted \\[ Pois(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\] where \\(k\\) is the number of events that occur in an interval given by rate \\(\\lambda\\).\nIn the above example, \\(\\lambda\\) is what we call a parameter. This is a value that describes, in a Frequentist sense, the “true value” of your population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOften, we are trying to figure out what the best parameter value fit for our data is, to try and get at the “true value” of where our data comes from. Say you want to know the average amount of chicks are in a clutch laid by the Black-crowned Night Heron in your neighborhood (which are found aplenty in Lake Merritt, a home to many a strange creature). The most obvious way to do this, would be to measure all of the chicks in each clutch! Then you would get the “true value” of the population mean. But, you realistically can’t measure all of the baby birds in the area. That’s a lot of time and patience, as well as luck that you simply don’t have. But! You do have a couple of Night Heron clutches that you found lying around, so you counted the amount of chicks in each of those. So this is your observed data. You then use this data to figure out what your best guess for a parameter would be.\n\n\n          size\nClutch 1     3\nClutch 2     3\nClutch 3     4\nClutch 4     7\nClutch 5     2\nClutch 6     7\nClutch 7     7\nClutch 8     5\nClutch 9     5\nClutch 10    1\n\n\nNow, let’s do some assuming here (the Frequentist view). Because we can only have a non-negative number of baby chicks and they are integers (you can’t have 0.1 of a baby chick) let’s assume that the clutch sizes come from the Poisson distribution, the one we mentioned earlier. Let us also assume that each clutch is independent and identically distributed, meaning that each clutch size does not depend on another and we assume that all of them come from the same distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat, but so what? We have decided that the observed data come from a Poisson distribution, but we still need to find the actual parameter \\(\\lambda\\) for this species. Well, luckily, because we’ve assumed our data is independent and identically distributed, we can treat each point (i.e. each clutch size) as independent events. Now, statistics is cool and has the rule that if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the probabilities of two independent events, then the probability of both happening is \\(A*B\\) (think of how the probability of getting two heads after two fair coin flips is \\(0.5*0.5\\) because the probability of getting heads is \\(0.5\\) and each fair coin flip is independent of any other fair coin flip).\nSo, keeping that rule in mind, we can get the probability that these 10 clutch sizes would happen by multiplying the probability of each one. Now, you might be thinking, we don’t know the probability of each one. But we do! Kind of. We know that they come from the Poisson distribution. Which is \\[ Pois(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\]\nNow, I know what you’re thinking: we still don’t know \\(\\lambda\\)! And this is true. But, when we multiple all of these together with our various \\(k\\) (i.e. our observed data, which is our clutch sizes), we will have a probability function from our data that relies on \\(\\lambda\\). As we test different \\(\\lambda\\), we will get different values.\n\\[f(\\lambda) = \\Pi_1^n \\frac{\\lambda^{k_i} e^{-\\lambda}}{k_i!}\\]\nNote that \\(n\\) is our number of data points and \\(k_i\\) represents a single data point value.\nAs we know, the higher the number from a probability function, the more probable it is for that scenario or set of conditions to happen. In this case, we want to find the value of parameter \\(\\lambda\\) from our function we have just created, that is the most likely. Can you guess the official name of our function now? It’s the likelihood function!\nNow there are a lot of assumptions in statistics and this took me a while to get used to.\nDo you have to differentiate every likelihood function you come up with? No!\nNote that we usually use a log scale for the"

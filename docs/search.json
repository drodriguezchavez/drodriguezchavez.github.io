    "text": "Recent Shows I’ve Seen\nThe two memorable shows from April are Forever Plaid at the Gateway Theatre (42nd St. Moon) and A Strange Loop at the Toni Rembe Theater (American Conservatory Theatre).\nIf you want a story with no plot, minimal set, and a lot of barbershop quartet sound, look no further than Forever Plaid. A jukebox musical from the late 80s, this show was essentially a barbershop quarter revue in the form of a show within a show (with some audience interaction). Accompanied by a combo of just piano and bass, the four actors used precise facial movements and tight, but intentional, choreography to bring each character to life, well more like after-life.\nAlso a show within a show… within a show… is A Strange Loop. Those of you who remember [title of show] might be worried about the potential for a cringe-meta mess, but this show is anything but that. Unapologetically black and queer, the audience is taken through the life of Usher and his six inner thoughts, each of whom plays additional characters throughout the show. A poignant question arising from the show is “what is the line between dramatization and caricature?” A mix of ballads, pop songs, and gospel themes propel the show forward, with the genre of the song often used for satirical enhancement. This is a story that needs to be told yesterday. Content warning for depictions of verbal abuse, physical abuse, and sexual scenes.\n\n\nRecent Shows I’ve Been In\nUPCOMING: Baby Rock at the Hollywood Fringe Festival\n\nMay 2024: Just My Type at Chanticleer’s Theatre\nOct-Nov 2023: Tintypes at Contra Costa Civic Theatre\nMay 2023: Family Copoli at Cornell University\nNovember 2022: Baby Rock at Cornell University\nNovember 2022: Avenue Q with the Melodramatics Theatre Company\n\n\n\nTheaters I Recommend\nThere are a lot of great theaters in the Bay Area. Below is a small subset that I frequent. However, for a more full list checkout Theatre Bay Area or my own personal list (where you can see which shows I’m planning on attending).\n\nThe Orpheum, Golden Gate Theater, Curran Theatre. These are all easily accessible by BART at show touring Broadway shows. Check out NightOutNightOff for cheaper tickets to these shows.\nThe Gateway Theatre. Easily accessible by BART and have cheap tickets on TodayTix.\nBerkeley Playhouse. Easily accesible by AC Transit and very close to campus.\nShotgun Players. Easily accessible by BART and AC Transit. Tend to have very community engaging shows."

    "text": "Growing up, I always enjoyed math. It was fun to solve these puzzles and figure out what I can create with a set of given rules. In addition to this passion, I also enjoyed playing the piano, a requirement for many children of immigrant parents. By the time I entered high school, I had decided I was going to major in math and music… with no plan for what I would do after college. However, two crucial things happened my senior year: I took AP Environmental Science (APES) and I music directed a show for the first time.\nAfter taking APES, I knew that I had to combine math and environmental science somehow, but I wasn’t sure how. I took on a motto: “help someone or something, somewhere.” This led me on a 4-year journey into carbon cycle dynamics, oceanography, and population dynamics, until I ended up in the world of infectious disease modeling. After music directing, I realized that this was how to keep my creative skills alive while being in community with others. I ditched the music major and doubled in mathematics and environmental science.\nGraduate school was not a clear step to me until my third year of college. As a child of Mexican immigrants, I rarely saw myself represented in the mentors and professors I had. Though I am eternally grateful to everyone that helped guide me down this path, I am really passionate about the communities I’m a part of and I hope to be the mentor that my younger self wanted.\nWant to create your own free website?

I’m really interested in infectious disease modeling and I plan to use this time to develop skills in statistical, computational, and mathematical modeling.\nOn this site you’ll get to know a little bit more about me, my research, and some of my community work. Because I am currently learning a lot of material on my own, I also intend to provide some write-ups in case that they are useful to anybody. Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time in the world of musical theater and I’m always happy to catch a show with someone new!"

    "text": "A classmate of mine in undergrad once told me that there are models that fit functions to data and then there are models that describe a theoretical framework but may not match data perfectly. The former by definition needs data while the latter can use data to corroborate theory. I am interested in gaining skills to do both of these!\n\nCurrent Work\nCurrently, I am exploring the spatio-temporal relationships between dengue, chikungunya, and zika in Brazil from 2016-present. I am interested in learning how statistical models can better understand these interactions for forecasting and use dynamical systems modeling to better understand multi-pathogen systems.

    "section": "",
    "text": "To start, let’s do the first thing many do when trying to learn about a new topic: go to the Wikipedia page for it. Let’s start with that first paragraph:\nIn statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data. This is achieved by maximizing a likelihood function so that, under the assumed statistical model, the observed data is most probable. The point in the parameter space that maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum likelihood estimate. The logic of maximum likelihood is both intuitive and flexible, and as such the method has become a dominant means of statistical inference. (Taken directly from Wikipedia.)\nHopefully if it’s not intuitive as of yet, it will be once we work through this. Let’s break down this first paragraph into various components: parameters, assumed probability distribution, likelihood function, and parameter space.\n\nLet’s first take about the assumed probability distribution. This is the type of distribution you assume your data is coming from. For example, for count data, we often use the Poisson distribution, denoted \\[ Pois(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\] where \\(k\\) is the number of events that occur in an interval given by rate \\(\\lambda\\).\nIn the above example, \\(\\lambda\\) is what we call a parameter.\n\nBut how does MLE actually work? There are three main concepts that I had to wrap my head around\nNow, in reality, what does this process look like?"

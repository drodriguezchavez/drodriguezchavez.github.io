It took me a very long time to become comfortable with using anything other than my textbook and notes when learning concepts in school. However, I've learned that I best understand something when I can visualize it and clearly write out all the steps. Because of this, YouTube has been an amazing resource, as well as other online sources where I can see how other people interpret and explain these concepts.

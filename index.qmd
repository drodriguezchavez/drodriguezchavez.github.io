Hello! My name is Daniela and I am a NSF Graduate Research & Chancellor's Fellow at UC Berkeley in both the de Valpine and Boettiger labs. I'm really interested in infectious disease modeling and I plan to use this time to develop skills in time series,

On this site you'll get to know a little bit more about me, the research I've done (and am currently doing),

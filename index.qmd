Hello! My name is Daniela and I am a NSF Graduate Research & Chancellor's Fellow at UC Berkeley in the de Valpine and Boettiger labs.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
x <- 1:5
y1 <- c(1, 2, 9, 16, 25)

# 2. Plot a first line
# plot(x, y1, type = "b", frame = FALSE, pch = 19,
     # col = "darkgreen", 
     # xlab = "x", ylab = "y", 
     # lty = 1, lwd = 1)
# dat <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = c(1, 2, 9, 16, 25))
# p <- ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
# 
# animate(p)
```
